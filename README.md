Ludo Dice Distribution Analyzer
Project Description
This project simulates rolling two dice in Ludo a million times using C. The program helps check if you really get 7s the most, and how rare 2s and 12s are. It prints out a table comparing how often each sum appears in simulation versus the actual/theoretical probability in math.

Concepts Used 
C Programming:
-For loops
-Arrays
-Switch statements
-Functions like rand(), printf(), scanf()

Maths:
-Probability
-Experimental vs. theoretical probability distributions
-Stochastic (random) simulation

How to Compile
To compile the code, type this in your terminal:
It will simulate 1 million dice rolls and print the result!
